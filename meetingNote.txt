### Meeting Notes â€“ Wed, October 10

- **Thank You Page + Fixed Instructions Position:**

- **User Data Storage:**
  - User details (name, age, gender, etc.) are successfully being stored in the `userdata` directory.
  - Status: Fully implemented and operational.

- **Trial Data Storage:**
  - The `data` directory is now tracking and storing user trial choices, including:
    - `user_id`, `name`, `list`, `trial_id`, `first_choice`, `second_choice`, `third_choice`, `fourth_choice`.
  - Status: Fully implemented and operational.

- Noted: I use .csv instead of .txt because it's more organized

#### Next Steps:
- Testing/Debug/ Fix the error cases possible
  - when user exit halfway, userdata is saved correctly while missing data
  - ensure we keep track of userCount correctly in userCount.txt
  - see other failed scenarios

- See .zip file and all trial, set up filler.csv, items.csv and change image 
  name accordingly to trial preparing to incorporate more trials into the website.
